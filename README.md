# YearOne Interview Prep

![YearOne](https://imgur.com/36NF1DV.jpg)

This repo is where we host our open-source interview prep topics and actions
that post to the YearOne community. We're open to contributions on the code,
interview prep topics & new features!

As a beginner-friendly open-source project, all you need to contribute is an
interview prep article, video, or code challenge to share and a pull request to
add it to our topics file!

YearOne is a FREE developer community for non-traditional software engineers who
have graduated from a coding bootcamp or who are self-taught, and have less than
2 years of professional experience as software engineers. We provide technical
interview prep resources, mentorship and on-the-job support through our
community platform.
